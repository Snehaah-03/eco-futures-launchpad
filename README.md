*DESIGN.EXE designathon 2025*

Eco Futures Launchpad is a sustainability-focused initiative that reimagines the future of fashion and fabrics by going back to nature. Our project explores the creation of eco-friendly textiles using natural dyes sourced from plants, flowers, and food waste â€” eliminating the harmful chemicals traditionally used in fabric dyeing.
