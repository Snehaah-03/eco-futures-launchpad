Eco Futures Launchpad is a sustainability-focused initiative that reimagines the future of fashion and fabrics by going back to nature. Our project explores the creation of eco-friendly textiles using natural dyes sourced from plants, flowers, and food waste — eliminating the harmful chemicals traditionally used in fabric dyeing.

🌱 Eco Futures Launchpad – Setup Plan
Dye It Naturally
Use plants, flowers, and food waste (like turmeric, onion peels, hibiscus) to create beautiful, chemical-free dyes.

Make Eco Products
Use dyed fabrics to craft simple, eco-conscious products like tote bags, scarves, and scrunchies — handmade and sustainable.

Build Our Digital Space
Set up a clean, minimal website to tell our story, display products, and explain our natural dye process.

Launch & Sell
Share our journey on social media, launch a small product batch, and engage with a community that cares about sustainable fashion.



## *Steps to run*  
🛠️ Steps to Run Eco Futures Launchpad
🌿 Collect Natural Dye Materials
Gather easily available plant-based sources like turmeric, onion peels, hibiscus, beetroot, etc.

🧪 Prepare & Test Dyes
Boil the materials to extract color. Use natural mordants (like vinegar or alum) to help the color bind to the fabric.

👕 Dye the Fabrics
Use organic or sustainable fabrics (like cotton or hemp). Try different dyeing methods: dip-dye, tie-dye, etc.

✂️ Create Products
Stitch simple, useful items like tote bags, scarves, bookmarks, or pouches — all naturally dyed.

🌐 Set Up the Website
Use your Vercel-hosted site to showcase the products, share the story, and include a basic order or pre-order system.

📸 Promote Online
Share process videos, eco facts, and product photos on Instagram and Threads to build an audience.

🛍️ Launch & Sell
Release a limited collection. Accept orders via website or social media. Encourage feedback to improve and scale.
